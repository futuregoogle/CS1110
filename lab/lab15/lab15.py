def put_in(alist,value):
    """
    MODIFIES the sorted list to include value, resorting as necessary.

    This function is a PROCEDURE.  It does not return a new list.  Instead,
    it modifies the existing list.

    Examples:
        If a = [0,2,3,4], put_in(a,1) makes a = [0,1,2,3,4]
        If a = [0,2,3,4], put_in(a,2) makes a = [0,2,2,3,4]
        If a = [], put_in(a,3) makes a = [3]

    Parameter a: The list to append to
    Precondition: a is a sorted list of ints

    Parameter value: The value to append
    Precondition: value is an int

def replace_first(alist,ovalue,nvalue):
    """
    MODIFIES the list so that the first appearance of ovalue becomes nvalue.

    This function is a PROCEDURE.  It does not return a new list.  Instead,
    it modifies the existing list.

    We do not guarantee that ovalue is in the list.  If it is not there, then
    the list should remain unchanged.

    Example: If alist is [5, 9, 1, 9, 7], then replace_first(alist,9,3) modifies
    the list so that alist is now [5, 3, 1, 9, 7].

    Example: If alist is [5, 9, 1, 9, 7], then replace_first(alist,3,2) does
    not modify the list at all.

    Parameter alist: the list to modify
    Precondition: alist is a list of ints

    Parameter ovalue: the value to replace
    Precondition: ovalue is an int

    Parameter nvalue: the value to substitute with
    Precondition: nvalue is an int
