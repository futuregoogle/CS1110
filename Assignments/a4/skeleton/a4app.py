"""User interface script for the module a4.

Asks the user for the rule number to use, and the length of the line for each
generation.

If the rule number is not an integer, the program stops. Similarly, if the line
length is not an integer, the program stops as well.

When both inputs are valid, creates a random line of cells of the requested
length, and calculates the first 100 generations, printing out each generation.
